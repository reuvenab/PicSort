# PicSort
At the home I have numerios pictures taken by different cameras.
I would like to have them ordered chronologically by directories in the format YYYY-MM

- Some files JPEG sometimes have EXIF header with information, in this case I use it to extract date
- Most of the times if EXIf is missing, file name is by itself enough to conclude about date
- Last resort is file modification time
